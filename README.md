# nanen_AI part

This is AI part of Naneun Project.

We used the ChatGPT API and you need to put your API_KEY value in the api_constants.dart file in the constants folder. The default language model is set to gpt-3.5-turbo and it can be modified according to your needs. If you press the record button and allow permission to use the microphone, your voice(speech) is translated into text and entered. The user's avatar is sored as an image generated by the GAN model(midjourney api) and functions are added.

**This is basic UI of our AI Part**
